  Package net provides a portable interface for network I/O, including TCP/IP,
  UDP, domain name resolution, and Unix domain sockets.

  Although the package provides access to low-level networking primitives,
  most clients will need only the basic interface provided by the Dial, Listen,
  and Accept functions and the associated Conn and Listener interfaces.
